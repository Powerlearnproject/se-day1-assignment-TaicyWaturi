Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the development of a software product using well defined,scientific principle, method and procedures.
Software Engineering is the backbone of the modern world i.e without software development we cant have our favourite apps, secure banking systems and even online learning platforms.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming Language e.g Fortrain C 
Establishment of software Engineering as a discpline in 1960
Rise of Agile Methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement -This is the stage of Gathering user needs and Software requirements
Design - Creating a detailed design of the software and user interface
Implementation- Writing codes and building software according to the provided designs in the previous stage
Testing -At this stage we coduct various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirement
Deployment - Releasing the software to the client/customer/users
Maintainance - Proving ongoing support,Updates and continuous improvement of the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - Sequential approach with each phase e.g Requirement,design,implementation,testing,deployment and maintainace flowing downward like a waterfall
Agile Methodogies -This is interative and incremental approach that focus on flexibily,collaboration and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- Responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - Responsible for ensuring solftware quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager- Responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Enviroments are software tools for writing,debugging and testing codes e.g Visual studio and Eclipes, While Version Control systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git,Subversion
The importance of software tools mentioned above are to improve productivity,collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as Code editor

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirement- Requirement may change during the development cycle leading to project delays
Tight Deadlines- The pressure to deliver the software on schedule can results in rushed development and compromise on Quality
Technical Debt - This comes from Shortcuts or suboptimal solutions,technical debts can impend future effort and increase maintainace cost

The following are strategies of overcoming challenges
        Effective communication
        Agile Methodologies
        Prioritization of task
        Regular reassement of project goals and Timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - Testing Individual componets or modules of software
Intergration Testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance Testing - Testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

Importance of software quality assurance is to help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is all about crafting Questions or Statements to get the best possible responsesfrom AI models
Prompt Engineering helps by making your questions clear and specific so that the AI understands what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about Kenya
Improved Prompt: Tell me about the history of kenya from who collonised them to the lineage of presidents to date.
